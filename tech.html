        <div class="box"><h1>{ Hi, I'm Leon and I like to code };</h1></div>

        <p>I go to the <span style="color: #0086b3">Olin College of Engineering</span> and am expected to graduate in 2019. I'm familiar with several languages, including Python, Java, SQL, MATLAB, Arduino, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Racket.</p>

        <p><b>My primary programming language is <span style="color: #0066cc">Python</span>. You can view some code snippets and past projects <a href="python.html">here</a>.</b></p>

        <p>I have had technical experience as an intern at Quantcast (summer '17) and Elemental Machines (summer '16).</p>

        <p>During my internships, I picked up and used many new skills, generated, implemented and compareed different solutions to a given problem, and learned about coding for scale and working on established codebases in a production environment, as well as working from scratch and iterating quickly to create a minimum viable product.</p>

        <p>I've done a good amount of public speaking in the past, and speak decent Mandarin. I was a photojournalist for the Republic of Singapore Navy for two years.</p>
